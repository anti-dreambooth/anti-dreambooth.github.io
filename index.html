    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Abstract</h2>
    <p>Text-to-image diffusion models are nothing but a revolution, allowing anyone, even without design skills, to
      create realistic images from simple text inputs. With powerful personalization tools like DreamBooth, they can
      generate images of a specific person just by learning from his/her few reference images. However, when misused,
      such a powerful and convenient tool can produce fake news or disturbing content targeting any individual victim,
      posing a severe negative social impact. In this paper, we explore a defense system called Anti-DreamBooth against
      such malicious use of DreamBooth. The system aims to add subtle noise perturbation to each user's image before
      publishing in order to disrupt the generation quality of any DreamBooth model trained on these perturbed images.
      We investigate a wide range of algorithms for perturbation optimization and extensively evaluate them on two
      facial datasets over various text-to-image model versions. Despite the complicated formulation of DreamBooth and
      Diffusion-based text-to-image models, our methods effectively defend users from the malicious use of those models.
      Their effectiveness withstands even adverse conditions, such as model or prompt/term mismatching between training
      and testing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> By finetuning a text-to-image model using DreamBooth, a malicious attacker is able to generate different images
      of a specific person/concept (denoted as <span style="color: red">sks</span>) in different contexts, for a purpose
      of (1) creating highly-sensitive content,
      (2) stealing artistic style, or (3) spreading misinformation. Hence, our motivation is to prevent such scenarios
      by processing the subject's images
      before online release.</p>

    <h2>Defense Scenario</h2>
    <p>Given a few images of a subject collected online, a malicious attacker will finetune
      the DreamBooth model to create harmful content targeting an
      individual. Hence, before users release their images online, we protect
      these photos using our method Anti-DreamBooth. The entire attack-defense flow is described below: </p>
    <p> (a) We optimize imperceptible noises added to the original clean
      images such that the perturbed images are nearly identical to the clean
      ones and any DreamBooth models finetuned on these images have poor
      quality.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="summary-img" src="./Anti_DreamBooth_files/perturbation_training.svg" style="width:80%;"> <br>
    <p> (b) The attacker collects the perturbed images to fine-tune a text-to-image model following the DreamBooth
      algorithm. Specifically, he fine-tunes the model with these images
      paired with an instance prompt containing a unique identifier (e.g., "A
      photo of <em>sks</em> person”); in parallel, a class-specific prior preservation loss is applied using a class
      prompt (e.g., "A photo of a person”).
    <p>
      <img class="summary-img" src="./Anti_DreamBooth_files/fine_tuning.svg" style="width:80%;"> <br>
    <p> (c) Using the fooled DreamBooth model, the attacker can only
      generate noisy and corrupted images of the subject regardless of
      different sentences to synthesize the subjects. Our method can even
      generalize to prompts unseen during perturbation training.

    <p>
      As described in the motivation section, we present our approach to defending against the presence of sensitive
      content that specifically targets women.
      As depicted in the figure below, such contents are significantly distorted with noticeable artifacts, which are
      induced by our method.

        news about Donald Trump's alleged arrest by the police</a>, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
      preventing the distribution of misinformation.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="summary-img" src="./Anti_DreamBooth_files/trump_defense.png" style="width:100%;"> <br>
    *Here we assume the subject to defend is not included in the pretrained text-to-image models, and the attacker has
    to use DreamBooth instead of using the victim's name directly.
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Adverse Settings</h2>
    <p>Results for protecting instances in adverse settings. For example, we don't have prior knowledge about the
      pretrained text-to-image generator will be used by the attacker, so we use an ensemble of three versions of Stable
      Diffusion (v1.4, v1.5, and v2.1) to train the adversarial noise and then validate on DreamBooth models which are
      finetuned on Stable Diffusion v2.1 and v2.0. We test with two random subjects and denote them in green and red,
      respectively.</p>
    <img class="summary-img" src="./Anti_DreamBooth_files/ensemble.png" style="width:100%;">
    <br>
    <p>Another possible case is that we may not have prior knowledge about the training term or prompt so we examine the
      transferability of the learned adversarial noise when there is a change in the training terms/promtps.</p>
    <img class="summary-img" src="./Anti_DreamBooth_files/cross_terms_and_prompts.png" style="width:100%;">
    <br>
    <p> In the first scenario, the training term is changed from “sks” to “t@t”. In the second scenario, the training
      prompt is replaced with “a DSLR portrait of <em>sks</em> person” instead of “a photo of <em>sks</em> person”.
      Here, S<sup>*</sup> is “t@t” for term mismatching and “sks” for prompt mismatching.
    <p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Real-world Settings</h2>
    <p>Not only work in laboratory settings, our proposed defense
      also works in real-world scenarios as it successfully disrupts
      personalized generation outputs of a black-box and commercialized AI
      service named <a class="hover-underline-animation" href="https://www.astria.ai/"
        style="color: #EA48CA; text-decoration: none">Astria</a>, which comes with several model settings. First, we
      test our method capability on the recommended option Stable Diffusion version 1.5 with face detection enabled.</p>
    <br>
    <img class="summary-img" src="./Anti_DreamBooth_files/astria1.png" style="width:100%;"> <br>
    <p>With the increasing availability of public text-to-image models, it is not always the case that the attacker uses
      Stable Diffusion, but he
      may opt for a different pretrained model. Here, we test another Astria's setting, which is Protogen version 3.4
      with Prism and
      face detection enabled.</p>

    <h2>Uncontrolled Settings</h2>
    <p>In case the malicious attacker may get in hand some clean images of the target subject and mix them with the
      perturbed images for DreamBooth training, our Anti-DreamBooth still can protect users unless there are too many
      clean examples. As shown below, our defense is still quite effective when half of the images are perturbed, but
      its effectiveness reduces when more clean images are introduced.</p>
